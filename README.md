## ðŸš€ Deployment

### Automatic Deployment with GitHub Actions

This project includes automatic deployment to production when code is pushed to the `main` branch.

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Add GitHub Secrets** (in your GitHub repository settings):
   - Go to your repository â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `SERVER_HOST`: Your server's IP address or domain
     - `SERVER_USERNAME`: SSH username (e.g., `jost`)
     - `SERVER_SSH_KEY`: Your server's private SSH key
     - `SERVER_PORT`: SSH port (usually `22`)

2. **Server Requirements**:
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed
   - SSH access configured
   - Git repository cloned at `~/web/portal.glab.si/public_html`

3. **How it works**:
   - When you push to `main` branch, GitHub Actions automatically:
     - Connects to your server via SSH
     - Pulls the latest code from GitHub
     - Runs the deployment script (`deploy.sh`)
     - Verifies the deployment was successful

#### Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
# On your server
cd ~/web/portal.glab.si/public_html
git pull origin main
./deploy.sh
```

#### Deployment Script

The `deploy.sh` script handles:
- Pulling latest code from Git
- Building Docker containers
- Running database migrations
- Setting up environment
- Starting all services
- Health checks
